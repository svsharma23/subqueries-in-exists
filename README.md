# SQL Subquery Practice â€” IN, NOT IN, EXISTS, NOT EXISTS

This project contains 8 practice SQL queries solved using both `IN/NOT IN` and `EXISTS/NOT EXISTS` subqueries.  
It uses a sample `users` and `user_orders` schema to simulate real-world logic filters.

### Topics Covered:
- Basic Subqueries
- NULL-safe NOT IN
- Filtering by order status
- Logical comparisons using EXISTS

### Tables:
- `users(id, name)`
- `user_orders(id, customer_id, status)`

### Sample Statuses:
- Delivered
- Cancelled
